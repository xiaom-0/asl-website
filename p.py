# Chapters
pdf.add_chapter("1. Acknowledgements", 
"""We would like to express our gratitude to our project supervisor for their invaluable guidance. We are thankful for the development communities behind MediaPipe, TensorFlow, and OpenCV for providing the tools that made this project possible.""")

pdf.add_chapter("2. Introduction", 
"""This project presents a real-time ASL (American Sign Language) hand gesture recognition system using computer vision and machine learning. The system recognizes static hand signs from a live camera feed and maps them to their corresponding ASL alphabet.""")

pdf.add_chapter("3. Background and Motivation", 
"""Communication with and among the deaf and hard-of-hearing community is essential, yet often hindered by the language barrier. ASL is one of the most used sign languages. However, tools to translate it automatically in real-time are still developing. Our goal is to create an accurate and accessible ASL interpreter based on hand gesture recognition.""")

pdf.add_chapter("4. Methodology", 
"""1. Dataset Collection: ASL image data from Kaggle was used with 29 classes including 26 alphabets.
2. Preprocessing: Resized images and applied data augmentation techniques like rotation and flipping.
3. Hand Detection: Used MediaPipe Hands to detect 21 key landmarks.
4. Model Training: Trained a CNN using TensorFlow/Keras for classification.
5. Real-Time Inference: Captured webcam input and passed the cropped hand image through the model.
6. Visualization: Displayed predictions and overlays using OpenCV.
7. Deployment: Built a Flask web app to serve video feed and predictions.""")

pdf.add_chapter("5. Tool Description", 
"""The tool consists of:
- Hand detector using MediaPipe
- Classifier trained with TensorFlow/Keras
- Visualizer using OpenCV
- Flask server for optional web deployment""")

pdf.add_chapter("6. Features", 
"""- Real-time gesture recognition
- Support for all ASL alphabet letters
- Visual overlay of results and confidence
- Flask interface for browser use
- Modular design to extend with new gestures or models""")

pdf.add_chapter("7. Specification", 
"""Hardware: Standard webcam, 4-core CPU, 8GB RAM
Software: Python 3.9+, TensorFlow 2.x, MediaPipe, OpenCV, Flask
Model: CNN with 3 convolutional layers, softmax output, trained on 87,000 images.""")

pdf.add_chapter("8. Analysis", 
"""The model achieved approximately 95% accuracy. Common misclassifications included M/N and U/V due to visual similarity. Real-time performance showed inference under 100ms per frame on average systems.""")

pdf.add_chapter("9. Visualization", 
"""The system overlays hand landmarks and the predicted letter using OpenCV. Flask allows users to view the system from a web browser. Optionally, performance metrics and graphs can be added using Matplotlib.""")

pdf.add_chapter("10. Future Work", 
"""- Extend recognition to dynamic gestures and words
- Improve model accuracy with transfer learning
- Support speech output for recognized signs
- Optimize for mobile or embedded deployment""")

pdf.add_chapter("11. References",

2. TensorFlow Documentation: https://www.tensorflow.org/
3. ASL Dataset (Kaggle)
4. OpenCV Guide: https://docs.opencv.org/""")
